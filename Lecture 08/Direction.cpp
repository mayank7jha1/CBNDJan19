/*
	A person wants to go from origin to a
	particular location, he can move in only
	4 directions(i.e. East, West, North, South)
	but his friend gave him a long route, help a
	person to find minimum Moves so that he can
	reach to the destination.

	Input  1 – NESNWES
	Output 1 – E

	You need to print the lexicographically(dic order)
	sorted string. Assume the string will have only
	‘E’ ‘N’ ‘S’ ‘W’ characters.


	Input  2 – SSSNEEEW
	Output 2 – EESS
